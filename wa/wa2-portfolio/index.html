    <h2>Research and planning (for submission) </h2>
        <p>Content Inventory:
My portfolio will have a short About page with my background and interests, a Projects section to show my work, and a Resume/Experience page with my skills and coursework (when we get there). I’ll also include a Contact page so people can easily reach me. 
Audience Consideration:
The main visitors might be recruiters or professors who want to see my work, but friends and peers might check it out too. I want it to be professional but still show some of my personality and creativity.
Structure Planning:
I’ll organize the site with a header for navigation, sections for About, Projects, Experience, and Contact, and a footer with links. 
Examples Analysis:
The portfolio sites I liked were simple and easy to navigate, with features that stood out but didn't make the site harder to use. They focused on the work itself with clear visuals and short descriptions. Some also used small interactive touches like hover effects, which made them feel professional but not hard to use.
Reflection:
I want my portfolio to show my creativity while demonstrating how it could be used for analyzing data and presenting it in a way that’s easy to understand. My biggest concern is keeping the site balanced between professional, creative and personal, without making it too busy.</p>
