    <h1>Welcome to Book Club Hub!</h1>
    <p>Book Club Hub is your digital gathering place for readers of all kinds. Whether you love mysteries, classics, or the latest bestsellers, this community was created to bring book lovers together. We make it simple to organize, share, and celebrate stories with friends — both online and in person.</p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>We believe books are better when shared. Our mission is to make reading a collaborative, joyful experience by giving book clubs the tools they need to stay connected, track their reads, and spark meaningful conversations.</p>
    <h2>What We Offer</h2>
    <p>At Book Club Hub, we’re more than just a place to talk about books — we provide resources that make reading and connecting easier:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Resources for Reading on a Budget: Tips for finding affordable (or free!) books through libraries, digital lending, and community swaps.</li>
            <li>Monthly Reading Guides: A simple plan that features one fiction and one nonfiction title each month, complete with discussion prompts and key themes to explore.</li>
            <li>Community Events in Boulder: From casual coffee shop meetups to author talks and local book fairs, we help bring our readers together outside the screen.</li>
        </ul>
