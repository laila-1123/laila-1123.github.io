    <section>
    <p>I am a third-year student at the University of Colorado Boulder, majoring in Business Analytics and Information Management with a minor in Creative Technology and Design. My background combines data-driven analysis with creative problem-solving, allowing me to interpret complex information and present it in clear, engaging ways that support strategic decision-making. With experience in data management, visualization, and design thinking, I bring both technical skills and creativity to every project.</p>
    <h2>Goals and Interests</h2>
    <p>My goal is to be challenged in my career and continue growing and learning personally, professionally, and creatively. In the future, I hope to focus on UX design, data visualization, or data analysis to help drive strategic business decisions. I also love to travel and take on new experiences, with Peru and Lisbon currently at the top of my list. Outside of academics and career, I enjoy film photography, hiking and backpacking, finding the best ramen spot near me, and true crime documentaries. </p>
