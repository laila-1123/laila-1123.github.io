      <p>I added a “Favorite” feature for generated images. There is a heart button next to the generate new images button.clicking it toggles the image into a  Favorites gallery that appears right under the “Generated Images” section. Users can hover over images they've already favorited to remove them. They can favorite as many images as they want.</p>
      <p>For my Google News critique project, I could use an API to pull in article titles and images to show how different outlets present stories. I’d probably use something like the NewsAPI or Google News RSS to get headlines and links, then grab each article’s cover image from its metadata or use a stock image API like Unsplash if needed.</p>
